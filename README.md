# ExploringTheNews

This project's Jupyter notebook is hosted here as a GitHub page: https://q-maze.github.io/ExploringTheNews/

Beginning with the 2016 United States presidential election and continuing through the 2020 presidential election and current COVID-19 pandemic, the United States political landscape has become increasingly polarized. This source of this polarization is attributed by many to real and perceived biases of the news media. This project aimed to explore this cultural trend through anlysis of articles published by three sources, The Guardian, PowerLine, and Daily Kos over the time period of mid-2016 to the end of 2017. The analysis techniques utilzed include sentiment analysis, word embeddings, and topic modelling.
